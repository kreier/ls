### Terminology:

- Skew
- Center (Mean, Median, Mode)
- Spread
- Standard Deviation

## [Interpret data - the CER (claim, evidence, reasoning) method](./docs/cer)

1. Identify the _Research Question_
2. Make a **Claim**: Statement that answers the research question
	- ONE sentence!
	- No reasoning
	- It should not start with yes or no
3. Provide **Evidence**
	- Use a graph, derived from collected data
	- Descriptive caption (Figure 2: What is shown on the graph)
	- Trendline, error bars, labeled axes
4. Link claim and evidence with **Reasoning**: Ties together the claim and the evidence using scientific principles
	- Can you use natural selection to explain why this positive relationship exists?
5. Identify _additional Research Questions_
	- What further questions should Aaron investigate?
