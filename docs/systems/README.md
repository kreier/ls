### 1.1 Termite Experiment 

[1.1 How do we do science.pptx]()
Short introduction to NGSS with 8 Science Skills and 7 [Crosscutting Concepts.pdf]()

Experiment in groups with termites. **DV**: What stimulus motivates the termites to follow the line? Possible IVs:
- Color of the line
- Thickness of the line
- Material of the line (pencil - graphite, sharpie - solvent with different smells, pen)
- Shape of the line (circle, elliptical, eight, interrupted, sharp corners)

In the notebook:
- Questions
- Hypothesis
- Observation
- Conclusion
- Reflection/Improvement

**Homework**
Write down your observations.

### 1.2 Asking questions, Phenomena: Frostbite (2022/08/16-17)

Review Termite Experiment:
[1.1 How do we do science.pptx]() slide 11: What are IV independent variables and DV dependent variables?

Questions - How to ask questions in Science? Can we categorize them?

[1.2 Asking Questions]() with the new Phenomena: Frostbite (slide 11)

Collaboration: What questions do you have?

**Homework**

Watch the [Video from bozeman science on NGSS models](https://youtu.be/8kj__V8ehDU), and answer [the worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AJxzTEWd6uHpPDdbIKyEIundE9gRikiSkp-iPAkvtgE/edit?usp=sharing) (assigned in Schoology)

### 1.3 Systems and System Models (2022/08/18-19)

Reflect on the questions from the Frostbite phenomena, collect them to slide 13 on the [Slide 1.1.2 Asking Questions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kkjeJpVQ2nBVTutSzfigeF4MmQ8IJKbuq3rTigz0lkY/edit?usp=sharing) presentation.

#### System Model: My Favorite Food

Students draw a model of their favorite food into their notebook. Most update their sketch from a picture of their food to a pure “words in boxes” model description of their food system.

**Homework**

Complete page 1 of the [1.3.3 Body Systems Lesson Notes Homework (student)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VIcvl19V7fzuk6GWha8KkVqVy3gjO4flyBKhy3D4uzA/edit?usp=sharing) with the help of informations on [1.3.4 Interacting Systems](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bvlKP7SpiGw0gVvv_hH4Xs6qqcT7UeXAAl7VMbXwpWM/edit?usp=sharing).


### 1.4: Body Systems (2022/08/22-23)

Knowing more about different tissues, organs and organ systems (from the homework) students copy the 5.1 Organ Systems Research table with 11 body systems to their notebook and (complete it).

Following the descriptions on 5.2 Body System Model - Thermoregulation and the example on temperature regulation with a thermostat  students in pairs develop a model for homeostasis and thermoregulation in humans. Key features are highlighted in the 5.2 Modeling Temperature Regulation.png

**Homework**

Create a model to show how your body controls and regulates its temperature. Take a picture of your work and upload it to the correct Jamboard: Block D or Block G.  






### 1.5 Refining the Model (2022/08/24-25)

Use the 6 Refining your thermoregulation model worksheet to evaluate your model and refine it - or create a new, improved version of it. The key parts are
- Set point
- Stimulus
- Receptors
- Control center
- Responder
- Response

To properly explain the function of the system we need at least 4 body systems:
- Nervous system - brain/hypothalamus
- Muscular - muscles
- Cardiovascular - blood vessels
- Integumentary - skin receptors

After you identified how to improve your model and did necessary changes, continue with the description and evaluation (written) part on the worksheet.

**Homework:**

Finish the description and evaluation of your model. Use the rubric provided in the worksheet 6 Refining your thermoregulation model





### 1.6 Feedback mechanisms (2022/08/26-29)

Start with a 20 minutes quiz on Schoology, body systems, organs and function and system models.

Then we review the concept of homeostasis and how feedback loops help maintain homeostasis. Using Alyssa’s frostbite example we determine if it is a positive or negative feedback loop. In this presentation we find some inspiration: 7 Feedback Mechanisms. After learning about negative feedback loops (negative as inverse, or opposite to the stimulus - important for a stable system) we reflect on Thermoregulation in Alyssa’s case. Further reading: 7.1 Homeostasis Presentation.pdf

[Pair Comparison](https://replit.com/@kreier/GroupAssign-2022-working?v=1) of the homework - How do the descriptions of Alyssa’s body response could be explained with the developed system model?

### 2.7: Using Graphs to Illustrate Homeostasis (2022/08/30-31)

Review of the Explanation or Model Description and Evaluation with 8.1 Model Thermoregulation

Worksheet on Graphing: 8 Graphing Models for negative feedback.pdf handed out to students, it demonstrates Homeostasis during exercise. Different groups create graph 1 and 2. Then compare and contrast the results. Finally all students create graph 3. 

**Homework**

Finish all 3 graphs and answer the related questions.
